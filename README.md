# Aye Spy

## With my little eye... 🐛 👀

### Brought to you by The Times Tooling team  🛠

Aye Spy is a high performance visual regression tool to catch UI regressions.

## Inspiration

Aye Spy takes inspiration from existing projects such as [Wraith](https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith) and [BackstopJs](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS).

We have found visual regression testing to be one of the most effective ways to catch regressions. It's a great tool to have in your pipeline, but the current solutions on the market were missing one key component we felt was essential for a great developer experience... performance!

With the correct set up you can expect 40 comparisons running under a minute.

## Concept

The idea behind visual regression is essentially image comparison over time.

There are a set of 'visually correct' baseline images of your site.

As you make changes to your site Aye Spy will take new images.

Aye Spy will then compare the latest images against the baseline images.

If there are differences the build fails and a report will be generated.
This gives you the opportunity to check the differences are expected.

If they are expected, update the baseline images

## Setup

In order to get the most out of Aye Spy we recommend 

  - Using the [selenium images from docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/selenium/) for consistent repeatable state 
  - Cloud storage (currently supporting Amazon S3)



To install the package:

`npm i -g aye-spy`


Example config to run Aye Spy:

```
{
    "gridUrl": "http://selenium-grid:4444/wd/hub",
    "baseline": "./baseline", 
    "latest": "./latest",
    "generatedDiffs": "./generatedDiffs",
    "report": "./reports",
    "remoteBucketName": "aye-spy-example", 
    "remoteRegion": "eu-west-1",
    "scenarios": [
      {
        "url": "http://thetimes.co.uk/",
        "label": "homepage",
        "removeSelectors": ["#ad-header"], // remove elements that are not static on refresh such as adverts
        "viewports": [{"height": 2400, "width": 1024, "label": "large"}],
        "cookies": [
          {
            "name": "cookie_name",
            "value": "cookie_value"
          }
        ],
        "waitForSelector": "#section-news", // explicitly wait for a selector to be visible before snap
        "onReadyScript": "./scripts/clickSelector.js", // run a script before snap
        "wait": 2000 // implicitly wait before taking a snap
      }
    ]
  }
```

## Using S3 Storage for images

In order to use the S3 Storage capabilities you will need to export some aws credentials:

```
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secretkey
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=keyid
```

Create an S3 bucket to store your images. 
Make sure to configure the bucket policy to allow viewing of objects.

## on Ready Script

For scenarios where you need to interact with the page before taking a screenshot, a script can be run which has the [selenium-webdriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs) driver exposed. 

Only es5 is currently supported so please transpile.

Example script:

```
const By = require('selenium-webdriver').By;

const landingPageNoErrors = async browser => {
    await browser.wait(until.elementIsVisible(browser.findElement(By.css(utils.getFirstName()))), 10000);
    await browser.findElement(By.id("firstName")).sendKeys("Bobby");
    await browser.findElement(By.css(".dob-day-option-field")).sendKeys("10");
};

module.exports = clickElement;
```

## Mobile Emulator

For scenarios where you need to use a mobile emulator, pass in the device name to the property `mobileDeviceName` on your config. Note that at the moment, this will only work with the chrome browser.

## Running

Take the latest screenshots for comparison:

`ayespy snap --browser chrome --config config.json --remote`

Set your latest screenshots as the baselines for future comparisons:

`ayespy update-baseline --browser chrome --config config.json --remote`

Run the comparison between baseline and latest:

`ayespy compare --browser chrome --config config.json --remote`
